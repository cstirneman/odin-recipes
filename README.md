# Project: Recipe Site

This is a simple site that showcases three recipes and demonstrates my current skills in HTML, Git, and GitHub.

## Skills Showcase
- **Git Cloning**: Setting up and cloning a repository from GitHub.
- **HTML Setup**: Creating a basic boilerplate for HTML files.
- **Use of Basic Elements**: Headers, images, anchor tags, unordered and ordered lists.
- **Use of Common Attributes**: `src`, `height`, `width`, `href`, `alt`, etc.
- **File Structure**: Organizing files into folders (e.g., `images/` and `recipes/`) to keep the project tidy and maintainable.
- **Git Commands**: Using `mkdir` and `touch` to create directories and files; adding files to the staging area, committing changes, and pushing to a GitHub repo.
- **Creating Commit Messages**: Writing helpful subject and body messages to clearly document changes.

## Self-Reflection
Completing this project helped reinforce my understanding of basic HTML principles and strengthened my confidence using Git and GitHub to manage and share code effectively.
